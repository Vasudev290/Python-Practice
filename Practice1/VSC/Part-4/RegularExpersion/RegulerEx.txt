RegularExpersion:
-----------------

A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; 
the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression 

To Devloper proggramming languages(complier and interpreter)
To Validate Data

python modules: re
------------------

This modules contains several inbulit function to use Regular expersion

List of bulit in function re :
----- -- ------- ------------

import re

fullmatch()
match()
search()
finditer()  -Return an iterator over all non-overlapping matches in the string. For each match, the iterator returns a Match object.
findall()
complie()
sub()
subn()

Where to use Regular expersion ?
------- ------------- ------------

2. Given email is valid gmail or not ?
3. Given email is official company email or not ?
4. Given text file contains - mobile and email id'

How to construct regular expersion:

character classes
------------------
a "character class" is a set of characters that you want to match
[abcd] : either a or b or c or d
[^abcd] : expect a and b and c and d
[a-z] : any lower case alphabet symbol
[A-Z] : any upper case alphabet symbol
[a-zA-Z] : any case alphabet symbol
[0-9] : any digit from 0-9
[a-zA-Z0-9] : alphabet and Number / alpanumber
[^a-zA-Z0-9] : alphabet and Number / alpanumber : special character

quatifier classes
------------------
a* : any Number of a
b* : any Number of b inculding zero Number
a? : 
a{4} : Exactly 4 a'

special classes
----------------
you need to use a escape sequence prefix with a backslash ( \ ). 
E.g., \. matches "." ; regex \+ matches "+" ; and regex \( matches "(" .

\s : Space character
\S : any character expect Space
\d : any digit from 0-9
\D : any character expect digit
\w : any word character [a-zA-Z]
\W : any character expect word(special character)
. : any character inculding special character
