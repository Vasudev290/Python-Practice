what are the conditional statement
             =====================
2.if-else
An if-else statement controls conditional branching. 
Statements in the if-branch are executed only if the 
condition evaluates to a nonzero value (or true ). 

3.if-elif-else
so the difference is that the code always checks to 
see if an 'if' statement is true, checks 'elif' 
statements only if each 'if' and 'elif' statement 
above it is false, and 'else' runs only when the 
conditions for all attached 'if' and 'elif' 
statements are false.

what are the iterative statement
            ==================
if we want to execute few statement, mulitple times we should go 
for iterative statement

1.for 
if we want to execute some action for every element present 
in sequnencs

2.while

Before that have to check 
1.initization, 2.conditional 3.incre & decr
  i=1,           i<=5          i=i+1
