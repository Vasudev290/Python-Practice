#Python Object orientaed programmimg language(OOPs)
--------  -----------   ---------------   ------------
Major OOP (object-oriented programming) concepts in Python include 
Inheritance, 
Polymorphism, 
Data Abstraction, and 
Encapsulation.
Class, - Class is template, Data Type, Draft and design to create or concetrate object
Object, - How to create object in python ;
Syntex;

class Account:
    
Account()

#We can create end no of object in class
#Class is template to create or concetrate end no of object
#Once object is create, In memory location allacted in heap memory area

#Function                                                #class

#Class Contains Variables and methods
#In python, Everything is a objects.
#With help of a1 we can access the class members.

class Contains methods and Variables
Variables= name:"vasu",age:"23"
methods= behaviour


what is types of Variables?

Class variables are three types :
--------- --------- -----------

                         Org_Name: TCS  => Static variable

            eid:101,                                       eid:102
            ename:'Vasu'  <=== instence Variable  ====>    ename:'Dev' 
            esal:45000                                     esal:55000      


1.instence variables  -> any variable value is varied from object to object 
2.Static variables  -> any variable value is not varied from object to object 
                     #It's created to one copy and share it to all the members.
3.Local variables  ->

what is types of methods ?

Class methods are three types:
1.instence method
2.class method 
3.static method
