#File handling
---------------

we have two type of files 
==========================
1. text files =>  any  files it contains character data we called as text files.
2. binary files => audio,video,images this are the binary files

to maintain this two files like text, binary they provide in-bulit modules.

Text files => character data

binary Files => audio, video, images

open() -- method/in-bulit function name is open()
fp = open(file_name, mode)  #Mode is important

fp.close()

7 type mode is there; Read and write
--------------------   -------------
Text files;                   Binary files
-----------                   --------------
r        r+                   rb           rb+
w        w+                   wb           wb+
a        a+                   ab           ab+
x                             xb

fp = open('one.json','r')  #if we not given any mode default mode is 'read' only;

type of read method;
--------------------

read() -  whole file 
read(n) -  no of chartacter
readline() - first line only
readlines() - []

type of write operation
--------------------------
1. write(str_value)
2. writelines(list of lines)

file text - modules
==============
r : read(whole file) open the existing file for read operation.filepoint :position at starting of file.
    note: if file not avilable, we will get "fileNotfounderror"
     
r+ : read and write
w : open the existing file for write operation.
w+ (Write and Read Mode): if file is not there it'll create atuomatically (new file created)
# both case w, w+ content is override only;

a(append) : In append mode override not going to happen
a+ : (append and read mode), Opens a file for both appending and reading.
x(exclusive_mode) :exclusive creation mode


fp=open()
what  if fp - file pointer/file object
various properties of file object.

name  -one.text 
mode  -w
readable () - false
writable ( ) True
closed -True
